# Unity WaypointPath

Class used to create a path using waypoints via a custom inspector script. This custom inspector draws handles to edit point positions in the scene view, provides a hotkey to delete a selected point and some other useful controls. During runtime, the class provides easy access for the path positions. Support for bezier curves is planned. The inspector is being drawn using the UIElements API.
